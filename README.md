# Transfer Learning-Based Road Sign and Road Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles Using YOLOv8 Models
This project focuses on the development of two essential detection systems aimed at enhancing the capabilities of autonomous vehicles: Road Sign Detection and General Road Object Detection. Both systems were built using the YOLOv8 architecture, renowned for its real-time detection efficiency and accuracy in dynamic environments.
The Road Sign Detection model was trained using a dataset comprising over 42 distinct traffic sign categories. These categories include Speed Limits, Warnings, Regulatory Signs, Information Signs, and more. The model was specifically developed using YOLOv8m to address the complexity of detecting a wide range of traffic signs encountered in real-world scenarios. The accurate classification of these signs plays a pivotal role in autonomous vehicles’ navigation and decision-making processes. Additionally, transfer learning was utilized to fine-tune the pre-trained YOLOv8m model for the task of road sign detection. This approach enables faster convergence and improved accuracy even with a smaller dataset, leveraging the knowledge the model has already gained from large-scale datasets.
For the General Road Object Detection task, we used the Udacity Self-Driving Car dataset, which includes road objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, traffic cones, and construction zones. The model was trained using YOLOv8n, designed for detecting a diverse array of objects critical to the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in various traffic situations. Transfer learning was also applied here, enhancing the model’s performance for detecting these specific objects by fine-tuning YOLOv8n with a smaller, domain-specific dataset.
In addition to developing these detection models, a web application was created to demonstrate and deploy these systems. The application allows users to upload images and perform real-time detection of road signs and objects. It integrates both models, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit. This web app showcases the practical implementation of object detection and road sign recognition, serving as a tool for users to experience how these technologies can be applied in autonomous driving systems.
Together, these models and the accompanying web app aim to improve road safety, enhance navigation accuracy, and provide a deeper understanding of how object and sign detection work in the context of self-driving cars.
